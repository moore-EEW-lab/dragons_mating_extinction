#Manuscript Title: A warmer and fierier world is driving showy dragonflies extinct
Year: 2025
 
#File 1 Name: extinctions.csv
#Description: local extinctions/persistence in the face for regional warming and wildfire activity for North American dragonfly species with different mating traits
#Rows: 1604, excluding the header. Each row corresponds to whether a species in a particular geographic locale persisted or went extinct between 1980 and the present
#Columns: 17. FID, Genus_species, Persistence, Family, Genus, Repro_strategy, M_wing_color, z.temp.change, z.all.burned, z.high.burned, z.hist.temp, z.per.obs, z.size, gen.spec, z.bio5, Change_mean_temp, future_change
 
#FID: unique identifier for geographic location in which species local persistence/ extinctions were observed

# Persistence: binary variable indicating whether a species that existed in a FID grid cell between 1980-2002 was observed again (1) or not (0) persist in that same FID grid cell between 2003-2021.
 
#Family: Taxonomic family of the species
 
#Genus: Taxonomic genus of the species

#Genus_species: Binomial nomenclature for the species

#Repro_strategy: two-level categorical variable corresponding to whether a species deploys the percher (p) or flier (f) behavioral strategy when defending reproductive territories

#M_wing_color: two-level categorical variable corresponding to whether a species does (y) or does not (n) possess at least some dark melanin ornamentation within its wing cells

#z.temp.change: z-transformed change in average monthly maximum temperature (°C) between the historical time period (1980-2002) and the current time period (2003-2021)

#z.all.burned: z-transformed cumulative amount of ln-transformed km2 area burned annually by wildfire of all severities between 1980 and 2021

#z.high.burned: z-transformed cumulative amount of ln-transformed km2 area burned annually by high severity wildfire between 1981 and 2021

#z.hist.temp: z-transformed change in average monthly maximum temperature (°C) during the historical time period (1980-2002)

#z.per.obs: the total number of observations of all species for each grid cell

#z.size: z-transformed body length (mm)

#gen.spec: whether a species was a specialist on a particular habitat (uses only forest or open habitats) or a generalist (uses both)

#z.bio5: z-transformed mean of the maximum temperatures that a species encounters across its range

#Change_mean_temp: change in average monthly maximum temperature (°C) between the historical time period (1980-2002) and the current time period (2003-2021)
#future_change: change in average monthly maximum temperature (°C) between the present (2021) and 40 years from now (2061)




#File 2 Name: FIDcoordinates_states.csv
#Description: location data for each 100 x 100 km grid cell used in this study
#Rows: 883, excluding the header. Each row corresponds to the geographic location of a 100 x 100 km grid cell in the contiguous United States. All coordinates are specified using WGS 84 coordinate system
#Columns: 4. FID, Latitude, Longitude, STATE_ABBR, STATE_NAME

#FID: unique identifier for geographic location in which environmental variables were measured and species local persistence/ extinctions were observed

#Latitude: the latitude of the centroid of a grid cell in decimal degrees

#Longitude: the longitude of the centroid of a grid cell in decimal degrees

#STATE_ABBR: the abbreviation of the US state in which the centroid of a grid cell is aligned

#STATE_NAME: the US state name in which the centroid of a grid cell is aligned
